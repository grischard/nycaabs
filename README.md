<h1>Nycaabs</h1>

<h3>(NYC Address and BIN Search)</h3>

Nycaabs searches New York City's open data sources for building information, by address or BIN (building identification number).

This project aims to help maintain NYC's OpenStreetMap data, in particular building footprints, heights, BINs, and addresses.
